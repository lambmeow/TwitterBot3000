# TwitterBot3000

This is a game that I made in 2018 for My school district's Hackathon (CodeD211).
This was made in the course of 2 days.
The gameplay consists of a visual novel where a "twitter bot" is created to suit your needs.
This game is inspired by DDLC so a lot of 4th wall breaking is present in this game.
